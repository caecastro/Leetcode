# Leetcode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Leetcode exercises.  
The goal is not to provide fully functional code ready to run with external inputs, but rather to share how I approached each problem and the reasoning behind my answers.

Leetcode exercises usually provide parameters externally, so I am not including those in the code.  
This means the solutions here are mainly for reference — to check correctness and understand the thought process — rather than for direct execution.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into three folders based on problem difficulty:

- **easy/** → Solutions to easier problems
- **medium/** → Solutions to intermediate problems
- **hard/** → Solutions to more challenging problems

## ⚠️ Note

- These solutions are intended for learning and reference purposes only.
- They are not designed to be directly runnable without the Leetcode environment.
- Feel free to explore the code to see different approaches and verify correctness.
